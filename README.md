This library aims to provide an implementation of:

* JW**S** [JSON Web Signature (RFC 7515)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515),
* JW**T** [JSON Web Token (RFC 7519)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),
* JW**E** [JSON Web Encryption (RFC 7516)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516),
* JW**A** [JSON Web Algorithms (RFC 7518)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
* JW**K** [JSON Web Key (RFC 7517)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

Tests vectors from [RFC 7520](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) are partially implemented.

# Status of implementations

[Please see this page](doc/Status.md).

# The Release Process

The release process [is described here](doc/Release.md).

# Prerequisites

This library needs at least:
* ![PHP 5.6+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-5.6%2B-ff69b4.svg).

Please consider the following optional requirements:
* AES-GCM based algorithms (AxxxGCM and AxxxGCMKW): [PHP Crypto](https://github.com/bukka/php-crypto) Extension (not yet available on `PHP 7` and `HHVM`).

# Continuous Integration

It has been successfully tested using `PHP 5.6` with all algorithms.

Some tests on `PHP 7` and `HHVM` were skipped because [PHP Crypto](https://github.com/bukka/php-crypto) is not yet supported.
At the moment, you will not be able to use GCM algorithms on these platforms.

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Spomky-Labs/JOSE) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/9123fbfc-7ae1-4d63-9fda-170b8ad794ee).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/22874677).

Code coverage is analyzed by [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/Spomky-Labs/jose). 

# Installation

The preferred way to install this library is to rely on Composer:

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/jose "dev-master"
```

# Extend the library

This library only contains the logic. You must extend classes (algorithms, compression, managers...) to define setters and getters.

Look at [Extend classes](doc/Extend.md) for more information and examples.

# How to use

Your classes are ready to use? Have a look at [How to use](doc/Use.md) to create or load your first JWT objects.

# Unsecured JWS

This library supports unsecured `JWS` (`none` algorithm).

**Unsecured `JWS` is something you probably do not want to use.**
After you loaded data you received, you should verify that the algorithm used is not `none`.

# Contributing

Requests for new features, bug fixed and all other ideas to make this library useful are welcome. [Please follow these best practices](doc/Contributing.md).
