### JWS or JWE

This library is able to handle signed JWT (JWS) and enrypted JWT (JWE).

JWS are JWT digital signed using one (or more) private key(s). The receiver of this JOT will be able to verify this signature is valid using your public key. If the signature is valid, the receiver can consider that the data received have not been modified and that your are the sender.

JWE are JWT encrypted your data using public keys of one (or more) recipient(s). A recipient will be able decrypt the data using its private key.

You can create signed and encrypted data. You have to create Ã  JWS and then create a JWE.

### JWK and JWKSet

The keys used to sign and encrypt are JWK objects.

A public key is able to verify a digital signature and to encrypt data using an algorithm. A private key can sign and decrypt data using the same algorithm.

You can group your keys in a JWKSet object. This object accepts any kind of JWK objects. It is recommended to group your public and private keys in different JWKSet.

All JWK and JWKSet are managed using a JWKManager object (read [Extend the library](Extend.md)).

### Data

A JWS or JWE object includes a signed data or an encrypted data. This library supports four types of data.

If you use JWS, you can sign

* a string: "Long live and prosper"
* an array: {"iss":"my.example.com","sub":"me@example.com","is_admin":true}

If you use JWE, you can sign

* a string
* an array
* a private key (JWK object)
* a set of private keys (JWKSet object)

## Creation of my first JOSE ##

First of all, you must have a JWTManager object and a JWKManager object to manage your keys and to create or load your JOSE.

In this example, you are Alice and you want to send a very important message to Bob: ```"Meet me in the front of train station at 8:00AM"```.

The public key of Bob is a RSA Certificate. Using JWK representation, it will be:

    array(
        "kty" => "RSA",
        "n"   =>"sXchDaQebHnPiGvyDOAT4saGEUetSyo9MKLOoWFsueri23bOdgWp4Dy1WlUzewbgBHod5pcM9H95GQRV3JDXboIRROSBigeC5yjU1hGzHHyXss8UDprecbAYxknTcQkhslANGRUZmdTOQ5qTRsLAt6BTYuyvVRdhS8exSZEy_c4gs_7svlJJQ4H9_NxsiIoLwAEk7-Q3UXERGYw_75IDrGA84-lA_-Ct4eTlXHBIY2EaV7t7LjJaynVJCpkv4LKjTTAumiGUIuQhrNhZLuF_RJLqHpM2kgWFLU7-VTdL1VbC2tejvcI2BlMkEpk1BzBZI0KQB0GaDWFLN-aEAw3vRw",
        "e"   =>"AQAB",
    )

Nota: to create such array from a X509 certificate, you can use the following method:

    <?php
    use SpomkyLabs\JOSE\Util\RSAConverter;

    $certificate = RSAConverter::loadKeyFromFile("/path/to/your/certificate", "passphrase"); //This method also accepts a string of the certificate in PEM format. "passphrase" is the passphrase used to secure the private key. This argument is optional.

Alice will encrypt the message (=create a JWE object) using the key encryption algorithm ```RSA-OAEP-256``` and the content encryption algorithm ```A256CBC-HS512```.

As there is only one receiver, we can use the compact serialization.

    <?php
    //We create and configure instances of JWKManager and JWTManager
    $jwk_manager = new JWKManager();
    $jwt_manager = new JWTManager();
    $jwt_manager->setKeyManager($jwk_manager);

    //We load the key of Bob (we suppose that you already stored it in your manager)
    $bob = $jwk_manager->loadJWKByKid("key-of-Bob"); //The public key of Bob is the same as above

    $jwe = $jwt_manager->encryptAndConvert(
        true, //We want a JSON Compact Serialized JWE (not possible if there are more than one recipient)
        "Meet me in the front of train station at 8:00AM",
        array( //Array of recipients
            array( //This is the array for Bob
                "key" => $bob, // The public key of Bob
                "protected" =>  array( //Protected header for this recipient only.
                    "alg"=>"RSA-OAEP-256",
                ),
            ),
        ),
        array( //Protected header for shared to all recipients
            "enc"=>"A256CBC-HS512",
        )
    );

The variable ```$jwe``` now contains your ecnrypted message. You can send it to Bob. The encrypted message will look like:

    eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUC0yNTYiLCJlbmMi...8drPvQGxL6L_r


## Load a JOSE ##

Bob received the message from Alice and want to decrypt the message. Bob has the private key used to encrypt this message in its JWKSet (managed by its JWKManager object).

The private key of Bob is:

    array(
        "kty" => "RSA",
        "n"   =>"sXchDaQebHnPiGvyDOAT4saGEUetSyo9MKLOoWFsueri23bOdgWp4Dy1WlUzewbgBHod5pcM9H95GQRV3JDXboIRROSBigeC5yjU1hGzHHyXss8UDprecbAYxknTcQkhslANGRUZmdTOQ5qTRsLAt6BTYuyvVRdhS8exSZEy_c4gs_7svlJJQ4H9_NxsiIoLwAEk7-Q3UXERGYw_75IDrGA84-lA_-Ct4eTlXHBIY2EaV7t7LjJaynVJCpkv4LKjTTAumiGUIuQhrNhZLuF_RJLqHpM2kgWFLU7-VTdL1VbC2tejvcI2BlMkEpk1BzBZI0KQB0GaDWFLN-aEAw3vRw",
        "e"   =>"AQAB",
        "d"   =>"VFCWOqXr8nvZNyaaJLXdnNPXZKRaWCjkU5Q2egQQpTBMwhprMzWzpR8Sxq1OPThh_J6MUD8Z35wky9b8eEO0pwNS8xlh1lOFRRBoNqDIKVOku0aZb-rynq8cxjDTLZQ6Fz7jSjR1Klop-YKaUHc9GsEofQqYruPhzSA-QgajZGPbE_0ZaVDJHfyd7UUBUKunFMScbflYAAOYJqVIVwaYR5zWEEceUjNnTNo_CVSj-VvXLO5VZfCUAVLgW4dpf1SrtZjSt34YLsRarSb127reG_DUwg9Ch-KyvjT1SkHgUWRVGcyly7uvVGRSDwsXypdrNinPA4jlhoNdizK2zF2CWQ",
    )

To decrypt the message, Bob will load the data he received:

    <?php

    use SpomkyLabs\JOSE\Encryption\RSA;

    $jwk_manager = new JWKManager();
    $jwt_manager = new JWTManager();
    
    $jwt_manager->setKeyManager($jwk_manager);

    $message = $jwt_manager->load("eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUC0yNTYiLCJlbmMi...8drPvQGxL6L_r");


The variable ```$message``` now contains the message of Alice: ```"Meet me in the front of train station at 8:00AM"```.
